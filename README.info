This library provides a thin interface between the atn_ primitives
and a farely typical (but far from general) MPI code.  Features are:

ADAPTING AND COMPILING THE APPLICATION

- See README.COMPILE in the examples_for_user directory


RUN THE APPLICATION

- See README.RUN in the examples_for_user directory


RATIONALE 

- All the "local" functions are left to MPI (e.g. setting up the
topology and the neighbors and possibly other utilities). A few MPI_
routines are substituted by tormpi_ routines.  In particular,
tormpi_Init does all the inits and set up a LUT to record which
processes are reachable through the atn_ network and which are not.
tormpi_Send/Recv and similar p2p routines either do the communications
via atn_ or fall back to MPI_ versions depending on the LUT.

LIMITATIONS 

- topologies created by MPI_Cart_create or others must be compatible
with the one specified in the atnsetup.conf.

- Only very short (<64KB) communications can be done with MPI_Send,
MPI_Recv, MPI_Isend, MPI_Irecv. In general the communicatins can be
done with MPI_Sendrecv, MPI_Isendrecv, MPI_Send_init, MPI_Recv_init

- requires openmpi with support for rankfile (v1.3 or later) and
assumes the relation between ranks and cartesian coordinates implicit
in openmpi (base topology).

- tags are ignored: the sends and recv must be posted in order foreach
link and core.

- recv's status is ignored

- MPI_Waitany, MPI_Waitsome, MPI_Testany, MPI_Testall, MPI_Request_*,
MPI_Cancel, MPI_Grequest_*, MPI_File_* are not supported when they
deal with requests routed vie the torus.

- ??

RECOMPILING THE TORMPI LIBRARY

- specify the system specific variables in the Makefile, in
particular the location of the mpi.h file and the libatn.a library

- inside the tormpi directory execute make.


FURTHER FUNCTIONS FOR OPTIMISATIONS

if your code uses nearest neigh communications ONLY, you may want to:
- Insert in your code tormpi_neigh_comm_only=1; immmediately before MPI_Init(). 
[work in progress: at the moment it must be changed inside tormpi_init and recompiled]
- Adapt and run the parser neigh_only_parser.sh, as described there.
